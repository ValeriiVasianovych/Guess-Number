# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player's task is to guess the hidden number. The player can make up to 4 attempts to guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10.
2. You need to guess the hidden number.
3. Enter your guess when prompted.
4. If your input is not a valid number, you will be asked to enter a valid number.
5. If your guess is out of the valid range (not between 1 and 10), you will be asked to guess again.
6. You will be given feedback on whether your guess is greater than or less than the hidden number.
7. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or reach the maximum number of attempts.
8. If you guess the correct number, you win and the game displays the number of attempts it took you.
9. If you reach the maximum number of attempts without guessing the correct number, you lose, and the game reveals the hidden number.
